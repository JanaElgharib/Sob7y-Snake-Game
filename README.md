- **WASD Keys:** Alternative movement controls
- **Space Bar:** Pause/Resume game
- **‚Üë/‚Üì or W/S:** Navigate menu options (Game Over/Level Complete screens)
- **Enter:** Select highlighted option
- Cannot reverse direction (prevents instant death)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Snake head with eye emoji (üëÅÔ∏è)
- Random fruit emojis for food variety
- Pulsing food animation
- Timer display for Level 4 (turns red when under 30 seconds)
- Speed indicator for Infinite Mode

- Epic rainbow background for Infinite Mode victory

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Vue 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **Vuex 4** - Centralized state management
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Composition API** - Modern Vue component logic
- **CSS3** - Advanced animations and styling
- **Web Audio API** - Dynamic sound effects

### Architecture

#### 1. State Management (Vuex)
Centralized store structure with comprehensive game state management

**State Structure:**
- Game status (menu/playing/paused/gameOver/levelComplete)
- Snake position array
- Food positions with emoji and timestamps (for timed food)
- Score and high score
- Current level and level configuration
- Grid settings and speed
- Timer state (for Level 4)
- Food timers array (for Level 4)

**Key Mutations:**
- `INIT_GAME` - Initialize game with level config
- `UPDATE_SNAKE` - Move snake and handle growth
- `CHANGE_DIRECTION` - Update snake direction with buffering
- `EAT_FOOD` - Handle food consumption and respawning
- `SET_GAME_STATUS` - Change game state
- `INCREASE_SPEED` - Progressive speed increase for Infinite Mode
- `START_LEVEL_TIMER` - Initialize countdown timer for Level 4
- `DECREASE_LEVEL_TIMER` - Countdown logic
- `CLEAR_LEVEL_TIMER` - Cleanup timer interval
- `ADD_TIMED_FOOD` - Spawn food with expiration timer
- `REMOVE_FOOD_BY_INDEX` - Remove specific food item
- `CLEAR_FOOD_TIMERS` - Cleanup all food timers

**Key Actions:**
- `startGame` - Initialize game, spawn timed food if needed, start timer
- `startGameLoop` - Main game loop with dynamic speed
- `gameStep` - Execute one frame of game logic
- `endGame` - Handle game over state with cleanup
- `completeLevel` - Level completion with epic sound for Infinite Mode
- `continueToNextLevel` - Advance to next level
- `togglePause` - Pause/Resume functionality
- `spawnTimedFood` - Create food with automatic expiration
- `startLevelTimer` - Begin countdown for Level 4
- `playSound` - Play audio feedback (eat, gameOver, levelUp, epicVictory)

**Key Getters:**
- `isGameActive` - Check if game is currently playing
- `isGamePaused` - Check if game is paused
- `isInfiniteMode` - Check if current level is Infinite Mode
- `hasTimeLimit` - Check if level has time constraint
- `hasNextLevel` - Check if there's a next level available
- `snakeLength` - Current snake length
- `levelProgress` - Progress percentage toward level goal

#### 2. Game Logic (Utils)
Pure functions for game calculations and configurations

**Core Functions:**
- `generateFood()` - Random food placement avoiding snake
- `moveSnake()` - Calculate new snake position with growth
- `checkWallCollision()` - Boundary detection
- `checkSelfCollision()` - Self-intersection detection
- `checkFoodCollision()` - Food eating detection
- `getLevelConfig()` - Comprehensive level configuration retrieval
- `initializeSnake()` - Create initial snake at grid center
- `getRandomFoodEmoji()` - Random fruit selection

**Level Configurations:**
Each level has detailed configuration including:
- Grid size, snake length, food count
- Speed and point values
- Special features (time limits, progressive speed, food lifetime)
- Win conditions and gameplay modifiers

## üéØ How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Start Game:** Select a difficulty level from the main menu
2. **Control Snake:** Use Arrow Keys or WASD to move
3. **Eat Food:** Guide the snake to collect fruit emojis
4. **Grow:** Each food item makes your snake longer
5. **Avoid:** Don't hit walls or your own tail
6. **Pause:** Press Space to pause/resume anytime
7. **Navigate Menus:** Use ‚Üë‚Üì arrows and Enter on Game Over/Level Complete screens

### Level-Specific Tips

**Level 1-3 (Standard Levels):**
- Plan your route to avoid trapping yourself
- Use the edges strategically
- Keep the snake moving in patterns
- Win by reaching the target score

**Level 4 (Surprise Challenge):**
- Watch the timer! ‚è∞
- Food disappears after 8 seconds - don't wait too long!
- You need 300 points in 2 minutes
- Quick decision-making is crucial
- Timer turns red when under 30 seconds remaining

**Level 5 (Infinite Mode):**
- Start slow, game speeds up every 100 points
- No time limit, but speed keeps increasing
- The only way to truly "win" is to fill the entire 20√ó20 grid (400 cells)
- This requires eating approximately 397 foods for ~3,970 points
- Speed caps at 30ms per move (extremely fast!)
- Most players aim for high scores rather than grid completion

## üîß Customization & Testing

### Developer Mode
To test Infinite Mode victory (since filling 400 cells is nearly impossible):

Add this to `GameBoard.vue` handleKeyPress function:
```javascript
} else if (key === 'v') {
    event.preventDefault()
    store.dispatch('game/completeLevel')
}
```

Press 'V' during gameplay to trigger victory screen!

### Adjusting Difficulty
Edit `gameLogic.js` to customize level configurations:
- Change grid sizes
- Adjust speeds
- Modify food counts
- Change point values
- Add/remove time limits
